c207 Week 02:
=======
  * `fibonacci.c` : A skeleton for Question 2 of the Lab (or just L2 for short). Download it and use it at a starting point for L2. It probably helps to save some of your time. Perhaps, you can also learn or recall something.
  * `birthday.data.txt` : A sample data file, in CVS format, for L4. Note you should combine L3 and L4 into one single program. If you are not sure how to read the data in `birthday.data.txt`, you can have a look at the next file.
  * `readBirthday.c` : A small and simple program that reads and prints out the content of `birthday.data.txt`, run it with `readBirthday < birthday.data.txt` .

How to use this github site?
----------------------------
### If you just want a single file, say, `all.c`:
  * Click on `all.c` and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your jEdit/editor window, then save as `all.c`

### If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c207-master` or `c207-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c207` from `Downloads` to under your working folder, say, `week2/`
  * If the downloaded `c207-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c207-master.ZIP`. If that failes, you probably need to use some other tool to unzip, ask Google.
