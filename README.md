c207 Lab Week 02: C revision
=======
Instructions for this lab:
--------------------------
  * First, goto **`LMS/Canvas`**, read the lab requirement for this week.
Next, download **`functions.c`**, try to compile and run it. Then, edit it according to the requirements. **After that:**
  * Download this **`c207`** directory (see instructions at the end of this text), and
  * Try **`readBirthday.c`** (which takes input from **`birtday.data.txt`**), and modify it according to the suggestions inside it, or as you wish. The main purpose is to revise your C programming skills. And then
  * If you think that readBirthday.c is too simple, try firther **`fibonacci.c`** which contains some advanced C elements.
  * Want somemore revisions? Explore the resources in LMS/Canvas.
  * If everything is just too easy for you, ask Anh for some challenging tasks.
  * If most of the above things seems too difficult to you, don't worry to much, but ask Anh for some suggestions/help.

Notes:
-----------------
If you have any questions regarding C programming, don't hesitate to put you hand up during lab time. Anh is delighted to help.

How to use this github site?
----------------------------
### If you just want a single file, say, `all.c`:
  * Click on `all.c` and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your jEdit/editor window, then save as `all.c`

### If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c207-master` or `c207-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c207` from `Downloads` to under your working folder, say, `week2/`
  * If the downloaded `c207-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c207-master.ZIP`. If that failes, you probably need to use some other tool to unzip, ask Google.
