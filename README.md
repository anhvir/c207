c207 Lab Week 02: C revision
=======
Instructions for this lab:
--------------------------
  * First, goto **`LMS/Canvas`**, read the lab requirement for this week.
Next, download **`functions.c`**, try to compile and run it. Then, edit/try it according to the requirements. **After that:**
  * Download this **`c207`** directory (see instructions at the end of this text), and
  * Try **`readBirthday.c`** (which takes input from **`birtday.data.txt`**), and modify it according to the suggestions inside it, or as you wish. The main purpose is to revise your C programming skills. And then
  * If you think that **`readBirthday.c`** is too simple, try further **`fibonacci.c`** which contains some advanced C elements.
  * Want somemore revisions? Explore the resources in **`Canvas`**.
  * If everything is just too easy for you, ask Anh for some challenging tasks.
  * If most of the above things, including the first item, seems too difficult to you, don't worry to much, but you certainly need more practice, and at least must finish the first item at home. You can ask Anh or your friends for some suggestions/help.

Notes:
-----------------
If you have any questions regarding C programming, don't hesitate to put you hand up during lab time. Anh is delighted to help.

How to use this github site?
----------------------------
### If you just want a single file, say, **`fibonacci.c`**:
  * Click on `fibonacci.c` and you will see its content in a markup format,
  * Click on **`Raw`** button, and you'll see it in text format, 
  * Copy the text content and paste into your editor window, then save as **`fibonacci.c`** in your local workspace.

### If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c207-master` or `c207-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c207` from `Downloads` to under your working folder, say, `week2/`
  * If the downloaded `c207-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c207-master.ZIP`. If that failes, you probably need to use some other tool to unzip, ask Google.
