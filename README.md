c207 Lab Week 03: C modules
=======
Instructions for this lab:
--------------------------
  * First, goto **`LMS/Canvas-->Modules-->Workshops-->Week3`**.
You can also click [here](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/8028/pages/week-3) to navigate to that link.
  * Read the lab section in **'workshop3.pdf'** from the above link.
  * If you fully undestand the text, perform the lab tasks one by one in the described order.
  * If you don't quite understand, cut the content of [play.c](https://github.com/anhvir/c207/blob/master/play.c) and do a small task together with Anh, that will help you to understand Makefile and modules.  
  * Play further with the package **`postfix`** which include **`postfix.c, alistair_listops.c, listops.h, stack.c, stack.h`**. Try to compile and run the package. Then write a Makefile for the package.


How to use this github site?
----------------------------
### If you just want a single file, say, **`fibonacci.c`**:
  * Click on `fibonacci.c` and you will see its content in a markup format,
  * Click on **`Raw`** button, and you'll see it in text format, 
  * Copy the text content and paste into your editor window, then save as **`fibonacci.c`** in your local workspace.

### If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c207-master` or `c207-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c207` from `Downloads` to under your working folder, say, `week2/`
  * If the downloaded `c207-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c207-master.ZIP`. If that failes, you probably need to use some other tool to unzip, ask Google.
