c207 Week 07:
=======

  Instructions this week:
--------------- 
  * For this week's lab, follow the instruction in LMS.Workshop.Week8. All the files needed for the lab are supplied there.
  * Then, spend some time to inspect `graph.c`
  * `graph.c` is the solution for week 7 lab, you just need to download this file and include it in your lab week 7 folder. `SPECIAL FEATURE:` I included 2 options for Dijkstra's, one of which is exactly as the pseudocode shown in the lecture, which can help you to see that there is not much difference between a pseudocode and a C function :-). This implementation of Dijkstra's also prints out all shortest paths. 
  * `week7_git_solution.zip` is a folder that contains all files needed for week 7 solution. You shouldn't need this one. It is useful only if you have lost all of your week 7 files.


How to use this github site?
----------------------------
### If you just want a single file, say, `all.c`:
  * Click on `all.c` and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your jEdit/editor window, then save as `all.c`

### If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c207-master` or `c207-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c207` from `Downloads` to under your working folder, say, `week2/`
  * If the downloaded `c207-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c207-master.ZIP`. If that failes, you probably need to use some other tool to unzip, ask Google.
