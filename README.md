Week 3:
=======

[**`Makefile1`**](./Makefile1) and **Makefile2**, **Makefile3** are all
equivalent. try them one by one in order to learn how to write
and use Makefile in a professional way.

[**`Lab_Notes.pdf:`**](./Lab_Notes.pdf)  A short guide on how to compile and run C
programs, including tools for using your laptop to work with
**dimefox** - a powerful university's server.  

# How to try, say,  **Makefile1**
1. copy **Makefile1** into your **race** directory (where you have files
**racecar.h**, **racecar.c**, and **racecar_test.c**) then run
```bash
cp Makefile MyMakefile
cp Makefile1 Makefile
make clean
make
```
(the first command is to backup your vertsion of Makefile, you should do it only once)

2. Try
```bash
make
```

3. Now try
```bash
make clean
make
```
and see the differences. 

4. Now try **Makefile2** then **Makefile3", they all are equivalent to **Makefile1**.
Make sure that at the end you see that you can use **Makefile3** for many other
projects, just with some triviall chnages.
