c207 Week 07:
=======
  The folder contain all files needed for a naive implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.

  Instructions:
--------------- 
  * Copy the hole folder to your computer,
  * Have a look at `*.h` file, and graph data file `graph_data.txt`
  * Implement function dijkstra() which is in `graph.c`
  * Test your program with `./dijkstra < graph_data.txt`


How to use this github site?
----------------------------
### If you just want a single file, say, `all.c`:
  * Click on `all.c` and you will see its content 
  * Copy the content and paste into your jEdit/editor window, then save as `all.c`

### If you want to download the whole directory:
  * Download this whole directory by clicking `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`, it will normally be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder under the name `c207-master` or `c207-master.ZIP`
  * Then copy or move the folder `c207` from `Downloads` to under your working folder, say, `week2/`
  * If the downloaded `c207-master` has the extension `.ZIP`, you likely need to expand the zipped file with command `unzip c207-master.ZIP`. If that failes, you probably need to use some other tool to unzip, ask Google.
